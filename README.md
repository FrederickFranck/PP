# Punctuality Pal

This is my final project for my IoT course.

It consists of an app for the [Bangle.js](https://banglejs.com/) (v1) smartwatch that allows you to track the timetables of the ferry I need to take to the school.

There is also an android app which is used to send your GPS location to the server and update estimated arrival time.

Also included is the server code which is used to store the timetable and the GPS location.
